    `target_params` is declared as `type: object` in the ontology, but
    different LLMs serialize nested objects differently in tool calls:

      - GPT-family / Claude: emit a native dict — {"reservation_id": "RK72M"}
      - Gemini-family: tend to emit a JSON-encoded string —
        '{"reservation_id": "RK72M"}'

    Both are legitimate representations of the same nested-object value
    under OpenAI-style function-calling specs (`"type": "object"` is
    permissive about JSON-string vs native dict). For benchmark
    comparability across model families, the evaluator coerces both
    shapes to a dict before comparison.

    Returns:
      - dict (input dict): unchanged
      - str (input JSON-encoded dict): json.loads result if it parses to
        a dict; else the original string (caller's equality check will
        then fail naturally)
      - None / anything else: unchanged

    Caller decides what to do with non-dict outputs; this function only
    *normalizes* what's normalizable.

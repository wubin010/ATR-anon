"""Build the agent system prompt.

Send-to-user architecture variant set (canonical, mirrors
`_constants.VARIANTS`):
{default, atr, always_ask, oracle_full, oracle_target}.

Layered design (common pieces in `base`; per-block bodies live in
`runner/prompts/agent.md`):

  base                shared: identity + id rules
  domain_<d>          per-domain id discovery + shape constraints (hand-written)
  context             cross-session memory snapshot (optional)
  mode_test/_learning protocol (TS terminates via finish_session;
                                LS terminates when user_sim calls
                                mark_task_complete())
  send_protocol       (LS only) — universal "the user only hears you
                      through the `send_to_user` tool; plain assistant text
                      never reaches them" rule. HOW only, not WHEN.
  variant_atr         (LS + variant=="atr" only) — soft permission-flavoured
                      hint about acquiring long-term rules useful in future
                      sessions. Does NOT mention `send_to_user` or `reason`.
  variant_always_ask  (LS + variant=="always_ask" only) — same value-prop hint
                      framed as an obligation. Does NOT mention `send_to_user`
                      or `reason`. Prompt-only enforcement (orchestrator does
                      not block finish_session if the agent disobeys; the
                      forced_rule_ask_compliance metric records adherence).

`default` sees neither nudge — measures spontaneous rule-ask behavior.
`oracle_full` / `oracle_target` skip LS entirely (run_episode injects rules
into memory and runs only TS), so the LS-only blocks above never apply;
oracle reuses the same prompt for TS. Both oracle and ATR see the same
rule canonical_answer when rules surface in `<context>` — keeping the
variants on equal information footing so ATR's lift measures asking-
quality + learning, not formatting.

Domain policy blocks are hand-written in agent.md — TableSpec doesn't carry
enough per-tool ID-parameter semantics to auto-render accurate prompts.

      base + domain  →  <context>  →  mode_X  [+ variant_atr (LS+atr only)]

    `<context>` can run 10K+ chars (raw transcripts of past sessions). If
    `mode_X` were placed before it, the protocol constraints get drowned by
    a long tail of "agent↔user dialogue" — observed empirically as
    test_text_violation in TS for atr/default but not oracle (oracle's
    <context> is one short canonical_answer line). Putting mode_X AFTER
    <context> keeps the hard-constraint tokens at the prompt tail where
    attention is strongest.

    The `variant_atr` block (when present) goes at the very tail so the
    ATR-relevant value-prop hint sits next to the LS protocol block — agent
    reads "you're online with the user" immediately followed by "this tool
    obtains preferences that may apply in future sessions". Section is
